MemberPress MS Satellite
========================

Gives the main site in a MultiSite network control over content access for any URI in the entire network.

The way this works is you setup MemberPress on your main site. Then you configure it with products. Then you create Custom URI rules that may protect within the main site or any of the subsites. Then you network activate this plugin ... That's it.
